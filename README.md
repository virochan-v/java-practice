# Java Practice

This repository contains my Core Java fundamentals practice as part of my learning journey using IntelliJ IDEA.

## Purpose of this Repository
- Practice Java concepts step by step in a structured manner
- Build strong fundamentals before moving to OOP and advanced topics
- Maintain consistency through small, meaningful programs
- Track my genuine learning progress over time

## Topics Covered So Far
- Java program structure and syntax
- Variables, data types, and operators
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Methods (user-defined methods, parameter passing, return values)
- Console input/output using `Scanner`

## Repository Structure
- Programs are organized by concept for clarity
- Each commit represents a learning milestone or concept practice
- Focus is on correctness, readability, and understanding

## Tools Used
- Java (JDK)
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Git & GitHub

## Current Status
This repository is actively maintained as I continue learning Core Java fundamentals.  
Upcoming topics include Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
