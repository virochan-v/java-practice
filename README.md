# Java Practice

This repository contains my Core Java fundamentals practice as part of my learning journey using IntelliJ IDEA.

## Purpose of this Repository
- Practice Core Java concepts step by step in a structured and disciplined manner
- Build strong programming fundamentals before moving to Object-Oriented Programming and advanced topics
- Strengthen logical thinking through small, meaningful Java programs
- Track my genuine learning progress over time

## Topics Covered So Far
- Java program structure and basic syntax
- Variables, data types, and operators
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Methods (user-defined methods, parameter passing, return values)
- One-dimensional arrays (traversal and basic operations)
- Two-dimensional arrays (matrix input, traversal, and basic operations)
- Linear Search (iterative search in unsorted arrays)
- Binary Search (searching in sorted arrays using divide-and-conquer approach)
- Order Agnostic Binary Search (handling both ascending and descending sorted arrays)
- Console input/output using `Scanner`

## Repository Structure
- Programs are organized by concept for clarity and readability
- Each folder represents a specific Java concept or problem type
- Searching algorithms are grouped logically under array-based problems
- Commits reflect individual learning milestones or concept practice
- Emphasis is placed on correctness, clean logic, and readability

## Tools & Technologies
- Java (JDK)
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Git & GitHub

## Current Status
This repository is actively maintained as I continue strengthening my Core Java fundamentals and problem-solving skills.
